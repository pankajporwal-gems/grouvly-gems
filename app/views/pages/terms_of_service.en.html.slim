          ul
            li
              h3 Paid Services

              p Certain of our Services are subject to payments (the "Paid Services").

              p Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing
                up for a paid service are deemed part of this Agreement.

            li
              h3 Billing

              p We use a third-party payment processor (the "Payment Processor") to bill you through a
                payment account linked to your Account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use
                of the Paid Services.

              p The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy
                policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement.

              p We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid
                Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices
                then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable
                payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your
                chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method").

              p You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to
                correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or
                received payment.

            li
              h3 Payment Method

              p The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be
                determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card
                issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.

              p If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree
                to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.

            li
              h3 Current Information Required

              p You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your billing
                account. You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account
                current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card
                number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify us or our
                payment processor if your payment method is cancelled (e.g., for loss or theft)
                or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the
                unauthorized disclosure or use of your username or password.

              p If you fail to provide any of the foregoing information, you agree that we may
                continue charging you for any use of paid services under your billing account
                unless you have terminated your paid services as set forth above.

            li
              h3 Change in Amount Authorized

              p If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you
                pre authorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state
                sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the
                amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the
                transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your
                use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and
                submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing
                cycle.

            li
              h3 Reaffirmation of Authorization

              p Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are
                authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit
                those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does
                not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be
                payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you
                initially selected to use the Paid Service.

        li
          h3 Termination

          p We may terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or
            without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which may result in the
            forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership.

          p If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so by following the instructions on
            the Site or through the Services. All provisions of these Terms of Service which by
            their nature shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership
            provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

        li
          h3 Cancellation and refund policy

          p Any cancellation or date change must be requested by e-mail or telephone at least 48
           hours in advance.

          p Less than 48 hours in advance no refund will be made for organisational reasons and
            compensation for the other group.

          p In the situation the other group cancels, the remaining group can ask for a refund in
            the case they do not want to be matched with another group.

        li
          h3 Warranty Disclaimer

          div
            p We have no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to you. You acknowledge that
              we have no control over, and no duty to take any action regarding:
